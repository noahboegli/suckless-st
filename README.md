# st - simple terminal
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


# Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


# Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


# Running st
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
